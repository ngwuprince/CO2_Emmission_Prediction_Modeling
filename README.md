# CO2_Emmission_Prediction_Modeling
This repository dives into the fascinating world of fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions in cars! We'll leverage the power of scikit-learn's Multiple Linear Regression to predict CO2 emissions based on various car features.

**Data:**

FuelConsumption.csv: Our trusty dataset, sourced from the Canadian government, holds detailed fuel consumption and CO2 emission data for new light-duty vehicles.
Features: From engine size and make to fuel type and transmission, we'll explore a range of factors influencing CO2 emissions.

**Objectives:**

Predict CO2 emissions: Train a Multiple Linear Regression model to accurately forecast a car's CO2 emissions based on its features.
Model development: Implement, train, and test our model using scikit-learn's powerful tools.
Transparency and reproducibility: Provide clear documentation and code to facilitate understanding and replication.

**Stages of Analysis:**

Data Loading & Cleaning: We'll load the data, check for missing values and inconsistencies, and prepare it for analysis.
Data Normalization: Ensure smooth sailing for our model by scaling features to a common range.
Train/Test Split: Divide the data into training and testing sets to evaluate our model's generalizability.
Model Development: Build and train a Multiple Linear Regression model, optimizing its parameters for peak performance.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's accuracy on the test set using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Model Usage & Insights: Explore how the model performs on specific car types and uncover valuable insights into CO2 emission trends.
